# Distressed Price

## Description
Calculate pricing with distressing options

## Logic
- Create a function that calculates pricing

    1. Price = Price either "add", "deduct", or no change based on distressing pricing
    2. Second priced and price higher than $300, add 1% each
    3. function accepts base price, products to add, distressing pricing

- Create a list of products with distressing prices
- Call the function to and display the price
